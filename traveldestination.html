                                <h3 width="72%" height="90" align="left" margin-top="80%" > <b> Oslo, Norway   </b> </h3>
                                    <p>  The capital, tucked neatly into the head of the Oslofjord on the south coast of Norway, has been passionately transforming its waterways and neighbourhoods to create a truly sustainable eco-haven. Recently labelled the ‘Electric Vehicle Capital of the World’, it’s not content with small measures, and the entire city has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050. Being green here is easy – bristling swathes of virgin forest known as Oslomarka encircle the capital, providing a wild playground for residents and visitors who stomp its hiking trails or plough through powder snow on cross-country skis. This human use of the forest is considered a crucial part of efforts to conserve it, and projects such as Friends of the Earth Norway’s eventyrskoger (fairytale forests) programme encourage people to spend time in its wilderness, exploring their own identity and emotions.

                                        But it’s not just eco-cred that makes this compact capital a must-visit. In June 2022, the new National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design will open on Universitetsgata, showcasing more than 5,000 items, making it the biggest gallery in the entire Nordic region. There’ll be an impressive collection of Edvard Munch works, including rock-star painting The Scream, and a plethora of diverse arts and crafts from Chinese imperial porcelain to contemporary conceptual pieces.     <br/>

                                  <h3 width="72%" height="90" align="left" margin-top="80%" >  <b> Egypt  </b></h3>
                                    <p> Almost 100 years ago, news of the most remarkable archaeological discovery had the world in its thrall. On 26 November 1922, British Egyptologist Howard Carter took the chisel his grandmother had bought him for his 17th birthday and chipped open the door to the hidden Tomb of Tutankhamun, gifting the world the most significant and best-preserved pharaonic tomb ever to be found in the Valley of the Kings. Almost 100 years before that, Jean-François Champollion announced his breakthrough in deciphering the mysterious Rosetta Stone, cementing the foundations of our modern understanding of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. 

                                        These two major historical milestones will be marked across the country next year, not least in the form of the Grand Egyptian Museum – set to become the largest archaeological museum in the world. Anticipated to open in November 2022, it will showcase the entire Tutankhamun collection, as well as the reconstructed Khufu ship – one of the oldest examples of an ancient vessel, which was sealed into a pit at the foot of The Great Pyramid of Giza in around 2500 BC. The release of Kenneth Branagh’s Agatha Christie romp Death on the Nile in February will further fortify the country’s beguiling appeal, with inspired travellers stepping aboard the plush small-capacity boats that meander in luxury along the world’s most famous river.    
                                        
                                        There are quiet, powerful stories gaining traction here too.

                            <h3 width="60%" height="90" align="left" > <b> Menorca </b> </h3>
                                <p> When Swiss art magnates Hauser & Wirth planted their flag on Menorca’s historic Isla del Rey in summer 2021, they gifted the island the sort of heavyweight credentials that have made the existing outposts bona fide cultural lodestones.

                                    The new art centre, which hosts its exhibitions in the repurposed outbuildings of a former naval hospital, also comprises an outdoor sculpture trail that tiptoes carefully around the archaeological remains of a sixth-century basilica. Although well used to reviving centuries-old gems, the gallerists had to navigate challenging terrain, a lack of electricity and a barrage of building restrictions. The result, however, is a secluded arty idyll, which will draw legions of aesthetically inclined travellers to the UNESCO Bisophere Reserve..<br />
